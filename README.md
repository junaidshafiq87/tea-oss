Batch File Renamer with Prefix
This project aims to create a simple and user-friendly open-source Python script for renaming a batch of files in a directory with a user-defined prefix.

Features:
Add any prefix to filenames within a specified directory.
Optionally rename files in subdirectories.
User-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy execution.

Testing:
Run the script from the command line using python batch_renamer.py.
Test with a sample directory containing various file types.
Try renaming files in subdirectories if the include_subdirs option is enabled.

Further Enhancements (Optional):
Add support for renaming files with specific extensions.
Implement progress bar or feedback messages during renaming process.
Allow users to specify a pattern for the prefix (e.g., numbering sequence).
Develop a basic GUI using a library like Tkinter for a more user-friendly experience.

contributions are welcome from others to make your project even more useful.
